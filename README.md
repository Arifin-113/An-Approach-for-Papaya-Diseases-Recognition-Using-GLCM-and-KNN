# Thesis on An Approach for Papaya Diseases Recognition Using GLCM and KNN
## 
• I have created dataset for 10 categories of bothleaves and fruits.
• Performed various preprocessing techniques on image data.
• Applied K-Means clustering for image segmentation.
• Extracted features through Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
• Executed classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## The full documentation of process in details would be found as Presentation file attached avobe.
